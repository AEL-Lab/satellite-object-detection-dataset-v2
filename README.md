# Satellite/Space Object Detection Dataset v2 (SODv2)
In this SODv2 dataset, we have modeled a dynamic solar system with accurate celestial scales and distances. LEO satellites were placed at altitudes between 500 km and 600 km with random orbital configurations. Each satellite was equipped with an onboard camera with a fixed 45-degree field of view (FoV), which sequentially captured images as the satellite moved through its orbit. The camera script automatically recorded distances and annotated bounding boxes for satellites detected within a 5 km range.
